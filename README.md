A tool to help search the PoE Trade API for items.

## Key Features

- Instead of manually inputting search parameters this tool uses the text that is copied to your clipboard to search the Trade API.

- Currently the tool is able to search for uniques and rares without considering explicit mods and will show the prices for the first 10 results.

- This is used mainly as a quick reference to gauge the value of random uniques and rares that are picked up.
